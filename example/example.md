# Example page

This is an example page created from a markdown file using the [NotionMD](https://github.com/brittonhayes/notionmd) package.

- Convert Markdown easily
- Integrate with Notion seamlessly
- **Some bold text**

*Hello*

---

This paragraph shows a soft line break
right here without a blank line.

This line ends with a backslash\
so this is a hard line break.

```go
package main

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
